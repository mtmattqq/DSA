## R-4.15

By definition $d(n) \in O(f(n))$ means that there exist real number $c_1 > 0$ and $n_1 \geq 1$ such that

$$
d(n) < c_1 f(n) \text{, for } n \geq n_1.
$$

Samely, there exist real number $c_2 > 0$ and $n_2 \geq 1$ such that

$$
e(n) < c_2 g(n) \text{, for } n \geq n_2.
$$

Consider $d(n)e(n)$, and $n_0 = \max\{n_1, n_2\}$, we have

$$
d(n)e(n) < c_1 f(n) \times c_2 g(n) \text{, for } n \geq n_0.
$$

Take constant $c_0 = c_1 \times c_2$, we found that 

$$
d(n)e(n) < c_0 f(n)g(n) \text{, for } n \geq n_0,
$$

which is the definition of 

$$
d(n)e(n) \in O(f(n)g(n)).

Let's consider the following function

$$
f(n) = n^2 (| \sin n | + \frac{1}{n^2})
$$

By definition $f(n) \in O(n)$ means that there exist real number $c > 0$ and $n_0 \geq 1$ such that

$$
f(n) < cn \text{, for } n \geq n_0.
$$

and $f(n) \in \Omega (n)$ means that there exist real number $c > 0$ and $n_0 \geq 1$ such that

$$
f(n) > cn \text{, for } n \geq n_0.
$$

Since $|\sin n|$ is a periodic function, and

$$
\text{for } n = \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi \text{, }k \in \mathbb N \text{ , } f(n) = n^2 + 1
$$

but

$$
\text{for } n = k \pi \text{, }k \in \mathbb N \text{ , } f(n) = 1.
$$

We can say that whatever $c$ and $n_0$ we choose, we can always find an real number $c < n_1 < c + \pi \text{ , } n_1 = \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi \text{, }k \in \mathbb N$ such that 

$$
f(n) > cn \text{, for } n = n_1.
$$

On the other hand, whatever $c$ and $n_0$ we choose, we can always find an real number $c < n_2 < c + \pi \text{ , } n_2 = k \pi \text{, }k \in \mathbb N$ such that 

$$
f(n) < cn \text{, for } n = n_2.
$$
